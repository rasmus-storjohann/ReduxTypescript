## Bootstrap: create-react-native-app

The project was bootstrapped with [create-react-native-app](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2017/03/13/introducing-create-react-native-app.html), which defaults to using expo for running your app on a phone or phone emulator, jest and react-test-renderer for testing, flow for typesafety and npm. I swithced from flow to TypeScript (see below) and I also prefer yarn to npm, but they both work off of the same `package.json` file.

## Store: redux

I'm using redux for local store, because the [Flux architecture](https://www.startuprocket.com/articles/evolution-toward-one-way-data-flow-a-quick-introduction-to-redux) just makes so much sense. These are the packages to install:

```
yarn add redux react-redux 
yarn add --dev redux-devtools
```

and then there is always quite a bit of boiler plate needed, actions, action create methods, action type constants, etc., more about that below.

## Typescript

I'm using TypeScript to squash bugs before they happen. With version 2.8, there is `ReturnType<>` which can be used to [simplify](https://medium.com/@martin_hotell/improved-redux-type-safety-with-typescript-2-8-2c11a8062575) a lot of the Redux boilerplate. With `Readonly<>`, TypeScript can enforce immutability at compile time, so there should be no need for `immutable.js`. I haven't worked with `immutable.js`, but it [seems](https://medium.com/@AlexFaunt/immutablejs-worth-the-price-66391b8742d4) to be good to avoid if possible.

Due to a collision between node and TypeScript both defining `require`, a [post-install script](https://github.com/aws/aws-amplify/issues/281#issuecomment-370049435) is needed that removes the node implementation. I created a file `bin/postinstall.sh` with this line in it:

```
sed -i -e "s/\(^declare var require: NodeRequire;\)/\/\/\1/g" node_modules/\@types/node/index.d.ts
```

and added this to `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
    "postinstall": "bin/postinstall.sh"
}
```

I then followed [this excellent write-up](https://medium.com/@rintoj/react-native-with-typescript-40355a90a5d7),  skipping straight to "Setup TypeScript" and followed along as far as "Refactor iOS to TypeScript". Then I renamed all my `.js` files to `.ts`, fixed all the errors from `yarn tsc` and finally removed the `.flowconfig` file that `create-react-native-app` created to complete the move from flow to TypeScript.

Configuration in `tsconfig.json` is locked down to make the compiler as thorough as practical, including setting `noImplicitAny`, `noImplicitReturns`, `noUnusedParameters`  and `noUnusedLocals`  to `true`. I ran into [some problems](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/24573) with some libraries that the TypeScript compiler didn't like, it helped to set `skipLibCheck` to true.

## TsLint

TsLint also helps squash a lot of bugs before they happen. I again prefer pretty locked down settings, including disallowing `any`, but follow your preferences. [tslint-immutable](https://github.com/jonaskello/tslint-immutable) is a set of additional tslint rules that enforce functional programming style and immutability that lines up really nicey with redux. Make sure the version of tslint-immutable is [compatible](https://github.com/jonaskello/tslint-immutable) with the version of tslint you're using. I installed with

```
yarn add --dev tslint-immutable
```

and added this script to `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": { 
    "lint": "tslint --rules-dir node_modules/tslint-immutable/rules/ src/**/*.ts"
}
```

## Testing

A number of packages are needed for testing. The "16" in `enzyme-adapter-react-16` refers to the `react` version, since I'm using react v16.3.1.

```
yarn add --dev babel-jest enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 enzyme-to-json jest react-dom ts-jest
yarn add --dev @types/enzyme @types/enzyme-adapter-react-16
```

As suggested by `create-react-native-app` I use jest as the test library. For testing react, I'm [also](https://www.codementor.io/vijayst/unit-testing-react-components-jest-or-enzyme-du1087lh8) using [enzyme](http://airbnb.io/projects/enzyme/). To make enzyme work, a setup file is needed, I named it `src/application/__tests__/setup_tests.ts` with this content:

```TypeScript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import EnzymeAdapter from 'enzyme-adapter-react-16';

Enzyme.configure({
    adapter: new EnzymeAdapter()
});
```

and pointed at it from `packages.json` like so:

```json
"jest": {
  "setupTestFrameworkScriptFile": "<rootDir>/lib/application/__tests__/setup_tests.js",
}
```

`setup_tests.ts` is compiled like all TypeScript files, `packages.json` is refering to the compiled js file that ends up in the `/lib` folder. BTW, the output location `lib` for compiled files is set in `tsconfig.json` in `outDir` under `compilerOptions`.

I have one working snapshot test. This needs a setting  `snapshotSerializers` under jest in `package.json`. I found quit a few articles with incorrect information on this, this is how I got it working:

```json
"jest": {
    "snapshotSerializers": [
        "enzyme-to-json/serializer"
    ],
}
```

I'm looking forward to using snapshots for some real world testing to see if it lives up to the hype.

Jest complains about the lack of an ErrorBoundary component, so I put one in (`src/application/error_boundary.ts`), don't know if it works yet.

TypeScript and snapshots don't play really well together, since the snapshots end up being written to the `/lib` folder next to the compiled js code. This means you can no longer just nuke /lib to clean, so I had to change the `clean` script in `package.json`:

```
"scripts": {
    "clean": "rimraf lib/**/*.js lib/**/*.js.map",
}
```

Likewise I had to update `.gitignore` so that I could commit the snapshot files:

```
/lib/**/*js
/lib/**/*map
```

The snapshots are written to a folder called `__snapshots__`, so for consistency I've had to stick with the conventional name `__tests__` for test folders. I was hoping to buck that convention and use `tests`, but that's probably just good for my OCD.

# redux-persist

For local storage, I'm using redux-persist, which saves the redux store directly to local storage. 

```
yarn add redux-persist
```

There is no need for a schema for local storage, but there is a need for handling migrations for when the user upgrades the app to the next version and still wants to access data saved by the last version of the app.
