# React-native bootstrap project with TypeScript

I spent a week getting my react-native project off the ground. Sincere thanks go out to all the authors of innumerable different how-tos and pro-cons on every piece of the teck stack I ended up using. I wanted to write up my experiences in case they might be of help to someone.

* [The teck stack](https://github.com/rasmus-storjohann/ReduxTypescript/blob/master/react-native-typescript-tech-stack.md): The rite of passage getting a dozen different libraries to actually work together. I hope this is of help to people wanting to work with some or all of these: : create-react-native-app, expo, typescript, tslint, redux, jest, enzyme, snapshots.
* [A way to use TypeScript to reduce redux boilerplate](https://github.com/rasmus-storjohann/ReduxTypescript/blob/master/dry-redux-with-typescript.md): My solution to the perennial problem of how to organize redux actions, reducers and stores.
* [Typesafe connect with TypeScript](https://github.com/rasmus-storjohann/ReduxTypescript/blob/master/connect-with-typescript.md): Getting the compiler's help to check redux `connect()` calls.
